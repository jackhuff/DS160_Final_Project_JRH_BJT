#### The poker hands data set explores machine learning in a unique way. By having a largely disproportionate distribution of classifying results, many of the machine learning models were not fit for this dataset. Using the Decision Tree Classifier and the Random Forrest Classifier models with varying parameters, we were able to produce results with accuracy scores between the range of 50% and 63%. The dataset came with both a training dataset and a testing dataset, and these datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models.
